# PIZZA-SALES-DATA
Analysis of pizza sales data to understand customer preferences, enhance marketing, maximize revenue and improve operations for a Pizza Company.

###  PROJECT OBJECTIVES
* Identify trends in Pizza sales based on customer ordering patterns and pizza popularity
* Provide actionable marketing and pricing recommendations for improved sales performance.
* Enhance marketing, maximize revenue and improve operations for the Pizza Company.

### DATASET OVERVIEW

**Source:** Open data source (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/pizza-sales-dataset)

**Tables Name:** Order details, Orders, Pizza types, Pizzas

**Key Fields:** order_id, date, time, order_id, pizza_id, quantity, size, category

### TOOLS AND SOFTWARE USED

* MS Excel and Power Query for data cleaning.
* MySQL for cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
* Power BI for Visualisation.

### KEY BUSINESS QUESTIONS

* What is the total revenue generated over time (daily, monthly, quarterly)?
* Which pizza types (and sizes) are the most and least popular based on quantity sold?
* How do sales differ across pizza categories (Classic, Chicken, Supreme, Veggie)?
* How does pizza size affect pricing, and which size provides the highest revenue contribution?
* Which day of week has the most pizza orders ?
* Are there underperforming pizzas that could be promoted or removed from the menu?

### KEY DATA INSIGHTS

* The data indicates a fairly diverse menu, but some products are far more popular than others
* Customers seem to prefer meat-heavy and cheese-rich pizzas, with chicken as a strong performer too, these are strong drivers of revenue.
* Very large sizes (XXL) and some small niche pizzas are underperforming which suggests either poor demand, pricing issues, or lack of marketing.
* Sales are relatively balanced across categories, but Classic pizzas dominate, showing that traditional flavors are the safest bet. Veggie pizzas also hold a strong 23.5%, which is notable.


### KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

* Keep investing in top sellers (Big Meat, Thai Chicken, Cheese variants).
* Consider removing or rebranding very low performers (The Greek XXL, niche small sizes).
* Focus marketing on Medium and Large Pizza sizes since extra Large Pizzas underperform.
* Offer bundle deals to push small sizes (e.g., sides + small pizza combo).
* Classics are safe revenue drivers — but highlight Veggie pizzas more, as they already perform well without heavy promotion. This could attract health-conscious or vegetarian customers further.
* Identify seasonal peaks to run targeted campaigns during high-demand months.
* Promote family deals with multiple large pizzas to encourage upselling.
